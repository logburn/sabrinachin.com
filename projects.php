  Heheh, Merry Christmas. This is the thing I just couldn't get done (the riddle, not the website), so I hope it hodgepodged itself together well. I wanted matching websites so I made matching websites :). I can change it to be anything you want, including a complete redesign if you tell me what you want.<br>Anyways, you can get started now if you want.
